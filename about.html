        <p>Hello! My name is Nandana, and I’m a junior at Arizona State University, majoring in Computer Science (Honors) with a minor in Media Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>I’m deeply passionate about connecting the worlds of technology and the arts, constantly seeking innovative ways to combine these fields in meaningful and impactful ways.</p> 
        <p>My experience includes an international internship as a UI/UX Research Intern at Hochschule Kaiserslautern, Germany, through the prestigious DAAD RISE Scholarship program. Additionally, I have enhanced my technical and programming skills through participation in hackathons, projects, and mentorship programs.</p> 
        <p>I love being involved and giving back to my community by embracing leadership opportunities. As a Community Assistant at ASU, I support incoming engineering freshmen by hosting events and connecting them to resources. I’m a huge advocate for women in STEM, serving as the Public Relations Officer for the Society of Women Engineers at ASU and being an active member of Women in Computer Science at ASU.</p>
